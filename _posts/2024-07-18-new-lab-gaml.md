## What is GAML?

GAML is a tool I made for myself which allows me to parse edits made to a file in git as content to be displayed on a blog post.

It allows me to display a new section at the bottom of a blog post which shows all the edits made to the post, including the author, timestamp, and message. I find this really useful as both a reader and an author.

I organically go in and edit posts, and I found it tedious to manually keep track of that, especially since git is already tracking that information. So I made GAML to automate that process.
