this year has been a year of consolidation and reframing
ive been resolving a lot of internal turmoil, primarily around my own identity
2024 was a rough year for me, and this year largely felt like a reaction to that
i focused less on my internet public persona, and more on my local life
i prioritized certain hobbies that made me feel fulfilled in some way, mostly creatively and socially
this year i started a new full time job and prioritized my personal relationships with friends and coworkers

i want to make more visual art
i want to make a game
i want to make more music
i want to program on fun projects
