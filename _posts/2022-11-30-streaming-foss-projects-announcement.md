title: "announcing a semi-regular foss building stream"
---
I really like building software. And when I'm not working on a client project, I love experimenting with different
technologies and platforms.

**I've decided to start a semi-regular streaming series where we will build, and then release, foss programs**

You can catch me [here on twitch.tv](https://twitch.tv/ctrlsquid) starting on December 2nd, 2022 at 12pm PDT where we're
going to start by building software that will connect Twitch chat to a midi-capable synthesizer!
