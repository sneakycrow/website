One of these days I'll manage to get one of these out on time. Until then, here's your monthly late status update!

I started working on more game development work! My main platform I want to develop, my
new [Analogue Pocket](https://www.analogue.co/pocket/) finally arrived! I've been having a lot of fun with it, and I'm
really excited to start developing for it. I've been working on a few small projects, and I'm hoping to have something
to show off soon.

Next, the startup I work for is finally starting to get some traction! We've been working on a few projects, and we're
finally starting to get some interest from investors. I'm really excited to see where this goes, and I'm hoping to
have more to share soon.

As far as life goes, lots of music and video games. I've been messing around with my
new [Bit Commander peda](https://www.earthquakerdevices.com/bit-commander), and I've been having a lot of fun with it.
I've also been playing a lot of [Baldur's Gate 3](https://baldursgate3.game/), and I'm really enjoying it. I've been
really impressed with the narrative flexibility and game mechanics. They've really made something special.

That's it for today's post, but know I have a lot of stuff in the work including some non-technical posts. Keep your eye
out for some Street Fighter 6 fight club details! Until next time, thanks for reading!
