I'm a big fan of integrating OAuth into all my applications, mostly because I usually have
some authenticated feature in my apps, but also because it is almost always an entrypoint into a
third-party API, which let's you do some fun stuff. For example, on my [music](/music) page,
I have a Spotify OAuth integration that let's me pull my data from Spotify, which enables
projects like [unwrapped](https://github.com/sneakycrow/unwrapped).
