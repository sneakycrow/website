### sad news, feel free to skip 

Well, sadly, the role I was excited about that started in January didn't work out. 
The worst part about it, is there was no issue with skill or culture. I got along more than well with everyone I met. 

But, unfortunately, due to a policy that was not communicated to me regarding cannabis usage, I was terminated.

Next time, I need to be more intentional about getting everything in writing. Because even though I was very open about all this 
with the employer during the interview process, the authority that told me cannabis was okay was just wrong.

It sucks, but human error is human. I understand why he thought it was okay, or why he thought he could "get away with it." 
They were excited to get me started ASAP to help with their infrastructure and application code base, but in moving so quickly 
they skipped over too many important steps.

Anyways, if you're reading this, I'm still just disappointed that you couldn't be bothered to call me.

### cool shit

#### Cobrashare 

I'm continuing to work on my projects for Sneaky Crow! I'm going to be giving some love to the Cobrashare project this month, 
cleaning up some OAuth issues as well as linking it up to Digital Ocean's spaces from AWS S3.

Also, I'm going to be slowly re-working some components from JS to TS, just to add more consistency to the langs I'm using (I've mostly replaced JS with TS).

#### Fulcrum

I'll be publishing a new command for you called !lastclip which is going to very simply send 
you the last clip it got, and what trigger triggered that clip. I'm also going to publish the 
dial functionality we talked about (I just forgot to push it through to live).

These updates I'll be doing over the next few weeks. They may not be complete before the end of the month as 
I'm going to be helping a friend of mine get his software project across it's launch point this week and probably a little next.

But I'm itching to get back into using Rust with fulcrum, and getting Cobrashare out of that MVP gate!
