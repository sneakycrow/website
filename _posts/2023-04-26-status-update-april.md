This month has been exciting in my programming journey. I finally decided to take the plunge and start trying video game
development, just for fun.

This week I'll be participating in the [Cozy Spring Jam 2023](https://https://itch.io/jam/cozy-spring-jam-2023-) to get
my feet wet. I'm going to be using [Bevy](https://bevyengine.org/) as my game engine, and I'm excited to see what I can
do with it.

I've also been working on a project called [chats-controller](https://github.com/sneakycrow/chats-controller) which is a
tool for streamers to let their chat control their game. It's been a fun project to work on, and I'm excited to see
where it goes. I'm hoping to get it to a point where I can start testing it with some streamers this summer.

Lastly, I'm still looking for paid work! If you're interested in working together on a
project [email me](mailto:zach@sneakycrow.dev)
