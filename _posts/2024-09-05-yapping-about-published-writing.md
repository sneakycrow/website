_This article doesn't really have proper form, it's just yapping_

I've been thinking a lot about the purpose of my work lately. I think it's really important to
have passion in your work, and I really pride myself on my website not being exclusively about
my career skills, but a more all-encompassing expression of my interests and thoughts. I love this website, it feels like my
own little corner of the internet, and I love that I can express myself here.

One conflicting part of me is publishing the work itself. I find myself doing a lot of different projects
at any given time, and of many varying types, and many times multiple projects at once. I love writing and playing music,
I love programming apps, embedded, web, and native. I love gaming, and drawing, and painting. I love
reading, writing, and photography.

I'm a very creative person, and I love to express myself in many ways.
I find the best work I do i s work that is done for me. And I find it tough sometimes to publish that work,
because I feel like it's not for anyone else. Or it's special, and I want it to be something that I only share with a few people.

It's a conundrum in digital age, where everything is shared and public. I often find it hard to express my level of skill sometimes
just because I'm not publically active beyond this website, and I don't really publish very frequently.

Maybe that means I publish more thoughts like these, and just be a little less critical about what's on here. Quality vs quantity.
