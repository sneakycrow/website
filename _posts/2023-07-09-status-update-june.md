Hello, and welcome to my status update for June 2023! The last few months have been quite busy for me, so this status
update is a bit overdue. I'll try to keep it short.

The gist of it, and probably as much as I can say right now, is that I started a new job at the beginning of June (the
one I mentioned in my last post)! I'm
working with some really cool and smart people, on a really neat project. I can't speak much on it now,
but I'm sure I'll have more to say in the future.

I've also been working on a few other things, but I'll save those for another post. Until then, thanks for reading!
