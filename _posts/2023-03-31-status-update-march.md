This month felt like a huge month in my Rust learning journey. I like to consider myself a perpetual student, and Rust especially feels like it has a ton of hills to climb over. One 
of which, is [Traits][traits]. I won't go into detail in this post, but the whole concept is fascinating and incredibly powerful.

On new project news, I started a project where we're taking a script for letting Twitch chat play video games and update it, adding 
a GUI and some new non-Twitch specific integrations as well. It's called [chats-controller][github-cc]
