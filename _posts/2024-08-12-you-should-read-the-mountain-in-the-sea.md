summary: "An review of the novella The Mountain in the Sea by Ray Nayler"
---

I recently read the novella [The Mountain in the Sea](https://www.raynayler.net/the-mountain-in-the-sea.html) by Ray Nayler.
It's a near-future cyberpunk-ish story that explores a lot of philosophical and ethical
questions about the nature of consciousness and the implications of AI.

I rarely go so out of my way to recommend a book, but this one really strikes all my fancies. The philosphical commentary is superb,
the approach to more scifi topics and how those intertwine with modern culture is really good, reminds me a lot of Blade Runner.

It's a great book that deals a lot with complex topics but keeps them very grounded and easy to follow. A great read that I think
everyone should read.
