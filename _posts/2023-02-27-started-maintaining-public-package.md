TLDR: maintaining the new package [here][repository]

I found [this really useful npm package](https://github.com/uptick/react-keyed-file-browser)
for [React](https://reactjs.org) about a year ago for the Cobrashare project and found it very useful.

Unfortunately, I found the it hard to integrate with newer react versions and typescript. Plus, passing my large UI
modifications was cumbersome,
so I decided to just fork the repository so I could make [my own version][repository]. They did great work here and I
want to build on it.

Feel free to jump in and help me out [on github][repository], it will remain for public use
