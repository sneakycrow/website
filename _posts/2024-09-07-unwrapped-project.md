summary: "Extending Spotify's Wrapped feature to include more data and more insights"
---

I've recently been working on a fun project I'm calling [unwrapped](https://github.com/sneakycrow/unwrapped). It's a tool I made
for ingesting and analyzing my recent track data, including data from Spotify and Apple Music. It allows more ingestion points, and allows me to analyze data based on more dynamic
criteria than Spotify Wrapped does, such as by specific dates, genres, and more.

I've been having fun developing it in Rust, and I'm in the process of writing a custom frontend for it as well.

I'll be integrating it into my [/music](/music) page soon, so you can see some of the data I've been collecting and analyzing. I'm excited to share it with you all!
