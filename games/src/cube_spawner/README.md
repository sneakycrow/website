# cube-spawner

A simple game where clicking will spawn a cube. The cube will fall down and bounce off the ground, as well as other
cubes whenever you click.
The last spawn cubed will change the color of cubes that it collides with to its own color.

## In Progress

- [ ] Add ability to spawn cube on click
- [ ] Have cubes spawn with different colors each spawn
- [ ] Have cubes change color when they collide with another cube
