My personal website. I use this as a professional portfolio, a blog, and as a general front-end to my other personal
applications

## CLI

I have a small CLI tool you can utilize to manage different pieces of static content, like blog posts. You can install it with
`just install-cli` or use it via cargo `cargo run -p scli -- {command}`
