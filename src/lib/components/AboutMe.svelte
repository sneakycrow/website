    My name is Zachary Corvidae, also known as sneaky crow. With over two decades of experience,
    I've been deeply entrenched in the world of application development, honing my craft and
    adapting to the ever-evolving landscape of technology. Throughout my career, I've had the
    privilege of contributing to a diverse array of projects and companies, ranging from <strong
      >industry giants</strong
    >
    to <strong>boutique agencies</strong>, and even <strong>venturing into entrepreneurship</strong>
    by founding multiple successful ventures.

  <p>
    Beyond the realm of coding and innovation, I find solace and inspiration in various hobbies and
    interests. Whether I'm crafting melodies, delving into immersive virtual worlds, exploring the
    depths of literature, or simply basking in the breathtaking beauty of the Pacific Northwest's
    natural wonders, I am constantly seeking new avenues for creativity and enrichment.
  </p>

    If you share a passion for innovation and collaboration, I'm always eager to explore new
    opportunities and potential partnerships. Feel free to reach out to me via <a
