Someone I follow and who's work I admire, [Brad Frost](https://bradfrost.com), is challenge himself to create something new every day in December.

This comes from a place of feeling uninspired and in a creative rut, which is a way I've been feeling lately too. Brad's post inspired me to do the same thing. So, for the entire month of December I will be completing or contributing to one project per day. 

Every day, by the end of the day, I will also be posting what I did and talking in detail about it if it's code related.

Here's some of the things I want to try and work on this month:

- Writing blog posts
- Development Projects
- UI Design
- Traditional Illustrations
- Digital Illustrations
- Concept Art
- Practicing Guitar

I'm hoping, just like Brad, this will kickstart my creative engine and get me back on the road.
