Today I decided to, mostly, take a break from coding and work on some of my other hobbies. Spent the day relaxing, working on some illustrations, playing my guitar, catching up on some video games, and watching some anime.

I think it's important to have other hobbies besides from stuff you do professionally, even if you're passionate about that. Not in a burnout sense, but more so in a perspective sense. Understanding other concepts from other professions and being able to apply those concepts to your own passions is so valuable.

Here's a few of the concepts I worked on today. I'm still getting the hang of drawing Baby Yoda, but the skull is turning out fantastically.
