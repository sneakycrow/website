For the second day of doing things in December, I started a new illustration piece. I spent some time getting some concepts going, and then getting started with some rough drafts. 

I like the concept I picked, and the first rough draft turned out alright. I want to adjust the scaling of Baby Yoda vs The Mandalorian, and then figure out what to do with the background.

I have also been watching some art fundamentals videos, and I'm hoping to incorporate those fundamentals into the final piece.

Here's some concepts and the first rough draft I made:
