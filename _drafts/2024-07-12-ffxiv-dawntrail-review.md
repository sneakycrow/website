## Preface

This article is a review of the 2024 Final Fantasy XIV expansion, Dawntrail. I have been playing Final Fantasy XIV since 2013, specifically beta v2.0, and have been a fan of the series since Final Fantasy VII (Crisis Core is my favorite, and definitely not because the main character's name is Zack...). I have played every expansion of Final Fantasy XIV, and have been a part of the community for a long time.

## Brainstorming

The beginning pacing was a bit vanilla
The "Act 1 finale" was very unexpected
Love the transition from Aztec/Mayan theme, to cowboy, to robots
Love the philosphical themes explored with alexandria
The last area reminds me of traverse town
The fountain scene reminded me of the Disneyland California Adventure water show
