## Preface

This article is a review of the 2024 Final Fantasy XIV expansion, Dawntrail. I have been playing Final Fantasy XIV since 2013, specifically beta v2.0, and have been a fan of the series since Final Fantasy VII (Crisis Core is my favorite, and definitely not because the main character's name is Zack...). I have played every expansion of Final Fantasy XIV, and have been a part of the community for a long time.

### Vanilla Beginning
Core: "The beginning pacing was a bit vanilla"

For some context, Dawntrail is the [number] expansion of FFXIV, and it's the beginning of a new "saga".
Up until now, all expansion releases have been part of the "Hydaelyn and Zodiark" saga. That ended with Endwalker, and excellently I must say. So Dawntrail has a lot to follow up on. My expectations going into this is not that Dawntrail would be nearly as Epic as Endwalker, in fact, I _hoped_ it didn't. I've found that if you try to follow up every peak with a larger peak, you fall into a Dragonball Z style of story writing. Character loses, character trains, character wins, rinse and repeat.

Dawntrail is the beginning of the "Dawn and Dusk" saga, which is a new story arc that will be explored in the next few expansions. We have a few new characters that are introduced between Endwalker and Dawntrail, namely Wuk Lamat and Erenville.

A large portion, most of it, is also accompanied by characters we know from previous expansions, mainly Krile, Alisae, and Alphinaud. We also get some brief interactions with Graha Tia, Urianger, Thancred, and the love-of-my-life Y'shtola, but it's light. I found that to actually be a good thing, because it allowed for our new characters to shine.


## Brainstorming

The beginning pacing was a bit vanilla
The "Act 1 finale" was very unexpected
Love the transition from Aztec/Mayan theme, to cowboy, to robots
Love the philosphical themes explored with alexandria
The last area reminds me of traverse town
The fountain scene reminded me of the Disneyland California Adventure water show
