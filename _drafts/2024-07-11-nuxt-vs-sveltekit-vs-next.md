## Preface

This article acts as a high level, opinionated, comparison of Nuxt, SvelteKit, and Next. I have experience with all three frameworks, and have used them in production. I have a preference for SvelteKit, the most experience with Next, and some minor experience with Vue, but I will try to be as fair as possible in my comparison.

I won't be diving into the specifics of each framework, but rather comparing them at a high level, and from the perspective of a developer. I will be comparing them based on the following criteria:

- **Ease of Development**
- **Ease of Deployment**
- **Resource Availability**
